#What is the problem that we are handling?
The increasing frequency and magnitude of viral outbreaks in recent decades, by the current
COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in an urgent need for rapid and sensitive viral diagnostic
methods. The symptoms of the disease can vary and include dyspnoea, high fever, runny
nose, and cough according to WHO. Instead of waiting for blood testing or RT-pcr which
takes approx. 5-6 hours to generate result. These cases can most commonly be diagnosed
using chest X-ray imaging analysis
#What is your approach to solve the problem?
Deep learning has shown a dramatic increase in the medical applications in general and
specifically in medical image-based diagnosis. Due to the very promising results provided by
CNNs in medical image analysis and classification, they are inspired by the visual system of
the human brain. The idea behind the CNNs is to make computers capable of viewing the
world as humans view it. This way CNNs can be used in the fields of image recognition and
analysis, image classification, and natural language processing.
#How do Convolutional neural networks work?
Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior
performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs. They have three main types of
layers, which are:
• Convolutional layer
• Pooling layer
• Fully-connected (FC) layer
